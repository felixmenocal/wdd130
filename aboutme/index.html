    <h2>Felix R. Menocal</h2>

    <p>Hello everyone!</p>

    <p>I'm Felix from Managua, Nicaragua. I am happily married to my beloved and beautiful wife Dianny with whom we have
        been sealed in the Temple for almost 8 years now, together we have two beautiful girls ages 6 and 4. I served a
        full time mission in Mendoza Argentina about 10 years ago.</p>

    <p>I'm an Electronic Engineer and now I am looking forward for a specialization in web development. I love what I
        have learned so far and I am very excited about what comes later in this course, although I have experience
        working with technology, I am somewhat new with programming language for web development, However, I really want
        to learn and make the most of this wonderful opportunity. One of the reasons I want to learn about this field is
        for be able to create marketing solutions and later I'm also interested in working with IoT solutions.</p>

    <p>Thanks for reading my website!</p>
