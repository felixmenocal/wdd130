            <button class="accordion">What is a web page or website?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>To answer this question, we need to review two concepts that are related and for that reason are
                    often used interchangeably: <br>
                    Web page: It is a document that can be displayed in a web browser (such as Google Chrome) <br>
                    Website: It is a collection of web pages that are grouped together and are usually connected in
                    various ways.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Why is it so important to have a website for your business?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>By creating a website, you are creating your online presence. This allows you to connect with people
                    you might not otherwise be able to reach.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">What do I have to do to have a website?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Choose and register a web domain name.<br>
                    Choose a hosting or web hosting plan.<br>
                    Choose a service provider of your choice for the design.<br>
                    Provide/approve the content of your business that will be presented to your potential clients.<br>
                    Do you have a logo? It is commonly found in the header of your business website<br>
                    With all these elements together, you are ready to publish your website.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">What is the price of a website?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Visit our <a href="rates.html">Rates</a> page for more details.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">The cost of my website is a single payment or a monthly payment?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The cost for the construction of your website is a single payment. However, the hosting of your
                    website is a payment that is renewed annually. Depending on the type of website you can pay for the
                    maintenance/update of your site as needed.</p>
