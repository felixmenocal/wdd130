                <h2>We love to answer your questions</h2>

                <h3> 
                    What is a web page or website?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    To answer this question, we need to review two concepts that are related and for that reason are often used interchangeably: <br> 
                    Web page: It is a document that can be displayed in a web browser (such as Google Chrome) <br> 
                    Website: It is a collection of web pages that are grouped together and are usually connected in various ways.
                </p>

                <h3>Why is it so important to have a website for your business?</h3>
                <p>By creating a website, you are creating your online presence. This allows you to connect with people you might not otherwise be able to reach.</p>
                
                <h3>What do I have to do to have a website?</h3>
                <p>Choose and register a web domain name.<br>
                    Choose a hosting or web hosting plan.<br>
                    Choose a service provider of your choice for the design.<br>
                    Provide/approve the content of your business that will be presented to your potential clients.<br>
                    Do you have a logo? It is commonly found in the header of your business website<br> 
                    With all these elements together, you are ready to publish your website.</p>

                <h3>How much does a web page cost me?</h3>
                <p>Visit our Rates page for more details.</p>

                <h3>The cost of my website is a single payment or a monthly payment?</h3>
                <p>The cost for the construction of your Web site is a single payment. However, the hosting of your website is a payment that is renewed annually. Depending on the type of website you can pay for the maintenance/update of your site as needed.</p>

                <h2>What are the main benefits?</h2>
                <p>
                    It is the control center for all the marketing of your business.<br>
                    It is the showcase to sell your products or services.<br>
                    It helps you generate leads (and makes it easier to retain customers).<br>
                    It allows you to compete with big brands.<br>
                    It helps you build credibility.<br>
                    A website for business is cheap (and very profitable).
